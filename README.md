# Car Rental System

This is a C++ project that simulates a simple car rental system. The program manages the details of cars available for rent, user information, and car rentals.

## Project Description

This project allows users to rent cars by selecting from a list of available vehicles, specifying the number of days, and providing user credentials. It keeps track of the cars available and those rented, ensuring that cars are not double-booked.

## Features

- **Car Management**: Add, remove, and list cars available for rent, including details like seats, rent per day, and car names.
- **User Management**: Create and manage users with unique usernames and passwords.
- **Car Rental**: Users can rent cars for a specific number of days, and the system calculates the total rent based on the number of days and the car's daily rent.
